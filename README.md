# Therapist Web Application

Welcome to the Therapist Web Application! This project is a fully functional React.js application designed based on a Figma design. It includes login functionality, dynamic data display, and responsive styling using Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Figma to React.js Conversion**: The application is developed based on a Figma design, ensuring visual consistency and responsiveness.
- **Login Functionality**: Users can log in using Firebase authentication. Upon successful login, users are redirected to a protected route.
- **React Router Setup**: The application uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, with routes for login, main content pages, and other necessary views. Authenticated routes are protected.
- **Dynamic Data Display**: A component fetches and displays dynamic data (simulated with static JSON or a mock API) with search functionality, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: The application is styled using Tailwind CSS, maintaining consistency with the Figma design and ensuring responsiveness.
